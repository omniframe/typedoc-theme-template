# ðŸ“¦ __THEME_NAME__: Theme for TypeDoc

This plugin is a theme for TypeDoc built for a richer and more engaging user
experience. We believe that documentation should be as beautiful and readable
as it is useful, and we hope this theme allows other Engineers to take a step
in that direction on their TypeScript projects!
